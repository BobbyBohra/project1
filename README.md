# Project1 — Animal Classifier / Assistant  

## 🔎 Overview  
This project combines a trained animal image classification model with a Python-based assistant / mini‑application. The model (`animal_model.keras`) is used to classify animal images into one of multiple classes and the assistant scripts allow interacting with that model (e.g. via voice/text input).
