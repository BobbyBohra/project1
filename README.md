🐾 Animal Image Classifier & Assistant

An AI-powered application that classifies animal images and provides intelligent insights about the detected animal using computer vision and machine learning.

🚀 Overview

This project uses deep learning techniques to classify animal images into different categories and acts as an assistant by providing additional information such as species details, habitat, and characteristics.

🎯 Features

🖼️ Upload animal images for classification

🤖 Deep learning model for accurate predictions

📊 Displays predicted animal name with confidence score

🧠 Provides additional insights (habitat, diet, facts)

🌐 User-friendly interface for real-time interaction


🛠️ Tech Stack

Python
TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch
OpenCV (image processing)
NumPy & Pandas
Streamlit (UI)


🧠 Model Details

Used a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for image classification
Trained on animal image dataset (e.g., Kaggle dataset)
Applied preprocessing techniques like resizing, normalization, and augmentation
