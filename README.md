# 🐾 Animal Image Classifier + Voice Assistant

A complete machine learning web application that classifies animal images using a deep learning model (MobileNetV2) and includes a voice assistant powered by **Groq**. The web app supports batch prediction (multiple images at once) with a modern glassmorphic UI.

## ✨ Features

- **Animal Classification**: Upload one or multiple animal images and get top-3 predictions with confidence scores.
- **Batch Prediction**: Process several images in a single request; results include image thumbnails.
- **User Authentication**: Register/login system with password hashing (Flask-Login).
- **Premium UI**: Glassmorphism design, drag & drop, image preview, responsive layout.
- **Voice Assistant** (separate script): Listen to voice commands, answer questions using Groq LLM, open websites, tell time, weather, play music.
- **Trainable Model**: Transfer learning with MobileNetV2 – easy to retrain on custom animal dataset.

## 🧠 Model Details

- Architecture: **MobileNetV2** (pre-trained on ImageNet) + GlobalAveragePooling2D + Dense(128) + Dropout(0.5) + Softmax.
- Input size: 224×224×3.
- Training script: `train_model.py` (supports data augmentation and validation split).
- Model saved as `animal_model.keras`.
